# 🍽️ Zomato Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on the **Zomato restaurant dataset** to extract valuable insights and prepare the data for future modeling tasks such as **rating prediction** or **restaurant recommendation systems**.

The analysis explores restaurant ratings, customer preferences, cost distributions, and country-wise performance to better understand patterns within the food service industry.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Handle and analyze **missing data**.
- Explore **numerical** and **categorical** features.
- Identify relationships between **restaurant attributes** and **ratings**.
- Perform **feature engineering** to enhance dataset quality.
- Generate **visual insights** using graphs and plots.

---

## 🧩 Dataset
**Source:** [Zomato Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data)  
**File Used:** `zomato.csv`  
**Encoding:** `latin-1`

**Key Columns Include:**
- `Restaurant Name`
- `Country Code`
- `City`
- `Cuisines`
- `Average Cost for two`
- `Price range`
- `Aggregate rating`
- `Votes`

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most restaurant records belong to **India**, followed by **USA** and **UK**.
- Ratings are classified as:
  - ⭐ 4.5–4.9 → Excellent  
  - ⭐ 4.0–4.4 → Very Good  
  - ⭐ 3.5–3.9 → Good  
  - ⭐ 3.0–3.4 → Average  
  - ⭐ 2.0–2.9 → Poor  
- A significant number of entries are **Not Rated**.
- Majority of restaurants fall in the **average rating range (2.5–3.4)**.
